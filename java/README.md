# Java Samples
All samples here use one or more Java clients and may have one or more web pages.

### Expectation Example
VoltDB stored procedures can have "expectations" that let you define the minimum expected number of results for a given query. Expectations can greatly simplify complicated stored procedure error checking code making the code much more readable.

### Upsert Sample
Demonstrates a simple "upsert" stored procedure using multidimensional demographic information to create specific user profile types that can later be targeted for direct ad placements.

### Tweet Geolocation Simulator
An application that uses a thematic map to show the distribution of hashtags across the globe. 

### Games ###
An online gaming platform simulation that tracks user session data, player scores, and leaderboards.

### Stock Orders ###
An app that demonstrates fast ingestion of equities orders and performs realtime analytics of top symbols and accounts by volume.  
(Used in our Capital Markets webinars)

### Stored Value Cards ###
An app that simulates high velocity transaction processing of pre-authorization, purchase, and balance transfer transactions on debit or gift cards, while maintaining fully consistent balances.

### Demographics Analytics
An app that demonstrates real-time analytics against a live data stream of user data. The data is broken down into demographic groups which can be viewed using a browser.

## More Coming
Many more applications coming soon. You'll soon see all of our code from our blogs appear here too.

## Contributions Welcome
